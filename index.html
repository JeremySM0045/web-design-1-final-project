                        <p>My name is Jeremy and I am currently a student of Graphic Design at Algonquin College.</p>

            <p>Through my studies, I have developed a solid foundation in design principles and have gained experience
                with a variety of design tools, including Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign),
                Figma, and Sketch. </p>

            <p> I am passionate about typography, layout design, and branding. I have also had the opportunity to
                experiment with other areas of design, such as motion graphics and web design.</p>

                <h3>Logo Creation</h3>
                <p>Your logo is the face of your brand and the first thing that potential customers will see, so it's
                    crucial to make a great first impression. I can help create a logo that is both visually stunning
                    and effective in representing your brand.

                <h3>Web Design </h3>
                <p>Your website is often the first interaction customers have with your business, so it's important to
                    make a strong first impression. I can help you create a website that not only looks great but also
                    functions flawlessly and engages your target audience.

                <h3>Full Branding</h3>
                <p>Your brand is much more than just a logo or a website. It's the overall image that your business
                    presents to the world, including the look, feel, and voice of your brand. I can help you create a
                    cohesive and impactful brand that resonates with your target audience and sets you apart from your
                    competitors.
